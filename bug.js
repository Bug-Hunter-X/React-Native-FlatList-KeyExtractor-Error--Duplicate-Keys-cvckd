This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and setting the `keyExtractor` prop incorrectly.  If the `keyExtractor` function doesn't return a unique key for each item in the data array, React Native may throw an error or display unexpected behavior. This is because React Native uses the keys to identify and update the items efficiently. If keys are duplicated, React Native gets confused about which item to update or remove, leading to various issues like incorrect rendering or crashes.
